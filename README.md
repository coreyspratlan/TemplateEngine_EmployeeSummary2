# TemplateEngine_EmployeeSummary2

User Story

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to email and GitHub profiles.

In this program I created classes and ran tests to check to make sure each template/boiler plate was functioning properly.  Once each class was made, I wrote questions to be asked of each employee and depending on their role, they were directed to more specific questions.  Once the questions were answered for each of the employees, the data was stored in an array and dynamically outputted to an html document to display on a web page.
